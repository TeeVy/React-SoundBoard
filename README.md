## How it works?
It's extremely simple.
* To create a category, create a folder in `public/sounds/`.
* Put your sounds in a folder located in `public/sounds/` (ex: `public/sounds/category 1/`).

### Installation
* `git clone https://github.com/TeeVy/React-SoundBoard`
* `cd React-Soundboard`
* `npm install`

### Run (Locally)
